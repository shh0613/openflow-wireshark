openflow-wireshark
===========

Wireshark dissectors for OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.1

It's based on [ng-of-dissector] by Nick Bastin, and CPqD's ofdissector(http://www.cpqd.com.br/)
Difference: add support for openflow 1.0 and complete others

only support for wireshark 1.6 ~ 1.10, and wireshark from version 1.11 has supported for openflow!
